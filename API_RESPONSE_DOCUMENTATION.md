---

### 6. `criterion_bands` (object)

**Type:** Dictionary with 4 criteria

```json
{
  "fluency_coherence": 6,
  "pronunciation": 7,
  "lexical_resource": 6,
  "grammatical_range_accuracy": 6
}
```

**Individual band scores for each IELTS criterion.** Each is scored 5.0-9.0 independently.

#### Criterion Definitions:

**`fluency_coherence` (float, [5.0-9.0])**

- How smoothly and naturally the candidate speaks
- Ability to maintain speech without excessive pauses or repetition
- Coherence: ideas are logically connected
- Uses metric: WPM, pause frequency, repetition ratio, hesitation

**`pronunciation` (float, [5.0-9.0])**

- Clarity of word articulation
- Stress patterns and intonation
- Overall intelligibility
- Uses metric: word confidence scores, low confidence ratio

**`lexical_resource` (float, [5.0-9.0])**

- Breadth and depth of vocabulary
- Use of less common words (collocations, phrasal verbs, etc.)
- Appropriateness of word choice
- Uses metric: vocabulary richness, type-token ratio, LLM vocabulary assessment

**`grammatical_range_accuracy` (float, [5.0-9.0])**

- Range of sentence structures used
- Accuracy of grammar
- Error frequency and severity
- Uses metric: sentence complexity, error analysis by LLM

---

### 7. `confidence` (object)

Confidence score indicating reliability of the assessment. Combines:

- Audio duration and quality
- Speech clarity (word confidence)
- LLM consistency and agreement
- Score stability across criteria

**Interpretation:**

- **0.9-1.0** - Very high confidence (excellent assessment reliability)
- **0.7-0.9** - High confidence (reliable assessment)
- **0.5-0.7** - Moderate confidence (fair assessment, some uncertainty)
- **0.3-0.5** - Low confidence (assessment should be taken cautiously)
- **0.0-0.3** - Very low confidence (unreliable, retest recommended)

---

### 8. `descriptors` (object)

**Type:** Dictionary with IELTS descriptors for the overall band

```json
{
  "fluency_coherence": "Able to keep going and demonstrates willingness...",
  "pronunciation": "Range of phonological features with variable control...",
  "lexical_resource": "Resource sufficient to discuss topics...",
  "grammatical_range_accuracy": "Mix of structures with limited flexibility..."
}
```

**IELTS band descriptors for the overall band score.** These are the official IELTS descriptions of what the overall band level means.

Each descriptor explains what a speaker at that band level is capable of.

---

### 9. `criterion_descriptors` (object)

**Type:** Dictionary with per-criterion descriptors + LLM enhancements

```json
{
  "fluency_coherence": "Able to keep going and demonstrates willingness. Coherence may be lost due to hesitation. 2 coherence breaks detected.",
  "pronunciation": "Range of phonological features with variable control. Individual words may be mispronounced. 25% of words show low confidence.",
  "lexical_resource": "Resource sufficient to discuss topics. Vocabulary use may be inappropriate. 2 word choice issues detected. 1 advanced vocabulary use noted.",
  "grammatical_range_accuracy": "Mix of structures with limited flexibility. Errors frequent but rarely impede communication. 3 grammar errors identified."
}
```

**Criterion-specific IELTS descriptors ALIGNED to each criterion's actual score (not overall).**

**Key difference from `descriptors`:** Each criterion descriptor is pulled from that criterion's band score, not the overall band. This ensures feedback is realistic and specific.

**LLM Enhancements:** Appended to the base descriptor:

- **Fluency:** Coherence break count, flow instability indicators
- **Pronunciation:** Low confidence word percentage
- **Lexical:** Word choice error count, advanced vocabulary usage count
- **Grammar:** Grammar error count, cascading error notes

**This is what shows users what ACTUALLY happened in their speech, not generic band descriptions.**

## Usage Guide for Frontend

### Basic Flow

1. **Submit Analysis**
   - POST `/api/direct/v1/analyze` with audio file
   - Returns: `job_id`, `status: "queued"`

2. **Poll for Results**
   - GET `/api/direct/v1/result/{job_id}` (no detail parameter)
   - Returns: Base response (minimal, fast)

3. **Display Results**
   - Show `overall_band` prominently
   - Show `criterion_bands` as a breakdown
   - Show `statistics` for word count and filler percentage
   - Show `normalized_metrics` for detailed analysis

### Displaying Band Scores

```
Overall Band: 6.0
├─ Fluency & Coherence: 6
├─ Pronunciation: 7
├─ Lexical Resource: 6
└─ Grammar & Accuracy: 6
```

### Displaying Confidence

```
Assessment Confidence: 44% (Low)
⚠️ This assessment should be taken cautiously. Confidence affected by: [details from confidence_multipliers]
```

### Displaying Key Metrics

Show a metrics dashboard with:

- **Delivery:** WPM (88.7), Pauses (2.2/min), Fillers (2.7/min)
- **Vocabulary:** Richness (0.54), Unique words, Repetition ratio
- **Quality:** Clarity (78%), Monotone (No)

### Using Descriptors

**Show criterion_descriptors (not descriptors) for user-facing feedback.**

These are specific to the candidate's actual performance, not generic IELTS band text.

```
Pronunciation: "Range of phonological features with variable control. Individual
words may be mispronounced. 25% of words show low confidence."
```

### Requesting Full Details

When user clicks "View Detailed Analysis":

- Call: GET `/api/direct/v1/result/{job_id}?detail=full`
- Returns: All fields including timestamps, errors, benchmarking

### For Feedback Tier (detail="feedback")

Call: GET `/api/direct/v1/result/{job_id}?detail=feedback`

Use:

- `transcript` - Display full speech text
- `grammar_errors` - Highlight grammar issues
- `word_choice_errors` - Show vocabulary problems
- `fluency_notes` - Display summary notes

### For Full Tier (detail="full")

Use `word_timestamps` to build a timeline visualization:

- Display each word with confidence color-coding
- Highlight fillers in different color
- Show timing bar with pauses

## Key Insights for Frontend

### 1. Criterion Descriptors Are the Source of Truth

**Don't use generic IELTS descriptors.** Use `criterion_descriptors` which:

- Are pulled from the candidate's actual criterion band
- Include LLM findings (errors, breaks, vocabulary)
- Provide specific, data-driven feedback

Example:

- **Generic:** "Able to keep going and demonstrates willingness..."
- **Specific:** "Able to keep going and demonstrates willingness. Coherence may be lost due to hesitation. 2 coherence breaks detected."

### 2. Confidence Score Matters

Always show confidence level and warn if <0.5:

```
⚠️ Low Confidence (0.44): This assessment may not be reliable.
Consider retaking the test for more accurate results.
```

### 3. Statistics Are Actionable

- **Filler %:** Shows exactly how much is filler (0.61%) - concrete metric
- **Word count:** Shows effort/length of speech
- **Monotone:** Single boolean indicator of prosody issues

### 4. Use LLM Findings in Context

- Grammar error count: How many actual mistakes
- Coherence breaks: How many times lost thread
- Vocabulary: Both word choice errors AND advanced vocabulary use

This is much more informative than generic band descriptions.

### 5. Metrics Tell the Full Story

- **WPM:** Too slow (70) vs. natural (90-110) vs. fast (150+)
- **Pause variability:** High = nervous/unsure, Low = confident
- **Vocab richness:** Direct measure of vocabulary diversity
- **Repetition ratio:** Shows if candidate is stuck repeating same words

## Important Notes

### Score Calculation Formula

```
Overall Band = round_to_0.5(
  (fluency + pronunciation + lexical + grammar) / 4
)
```

All bands use this same formula. No weighting - equal emphasis on all criteria.

### Response Tier Default Behavior

- **No detail parameter:** Returns base response only (fastest, smallest)
- **detail=feedback:** Adds transcript and feedback fields
- **detail=full:** Adds timestamps and detailed breakdown (largest)

Choose appropriate tier based on use case:

- Dashboard overview → default
- Feedback email → feedback
- Detailed analysis tool → full

### Timestamp Accuracy

Timestamps are in seconds (float format):

- 0.0 = start of audio
- 8.5 = 8.5 seconds into audio
- Precision: typically 0.01s (10ms)

### Error Codes

When `status: "error"`, the `error` field contains human-readable error message. Common errors:

- "No speech detected in audio file"
- "Audio quality too poor for analysis"
- "Analysis timeout"
